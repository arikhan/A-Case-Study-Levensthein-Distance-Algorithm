# A-Case-Study-Levenshtein-Distance-Algorithm
Levenshtein Algorithm is the smallest distance calculator between any given two words by using a traditional Levensthein Matrix. In this case study, you will have a Column Array instead of the Matrix with an Index holder to solve the problem in the same way.
